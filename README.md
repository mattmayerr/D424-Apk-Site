# ðŸ“² How to Install an APK File on Android
Step 1: Prepare Your Phone
Unlock Developer Access to Unknown Sources (if needed):

Go to Settings > Security (or Privacy & Security).

Tap Install unknown apps or Unknown sources.

Choose the app (e.g., your browser or file manager) that you'll use to open the APK.

Toggle "Allow from this source" ON.
# Step 2: Transfer the APK File to Your Phone
You can do this in one of several ways:

Email the APK to yourself and download it from your phone.

Use USB to drag the file from your computer to your phone's Downloads folder.

Upload to Google Drive or another cloud storage service and download it from there.

Use a file sharing app (like AirDroid, SHAREit, or Snapdrop).
# Step 3: Install the APK
Open your File Manager app (or your browserâ€™s Downloads if you downloaded it directly).

Navigate to the .apk file.

Tap the file.

Youâ€™ll see a prompt asking if you want to install the app. Tap Install.

Wait for it to complete and then tap Open (or Done, if you want to open it later).
# âœ… Optional Tips
You may want to scan the APK with antivirus software if it's from an unknown source.

Once installed, consider revoking the "install unknown apps" permission for added security.

If you're installing a debug APK, enable Developer Options and toggle USB Debugging if needed.
